The count-min sketch (CMS) is a probabilistic data structure which is useful when dealing with streams of data. A CMS uses hashing to map events to the frequency of that event. However, due to its probabilistic nature, a CMS uses sub-linear space while also overcounting some events. They are very similar to Bloom filters.
